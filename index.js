// 36. Introducing Inline Styles
// There are other complex concepts that add powerful capabilities to your React code. But you may be wondering about the more simple problem of how to style those JSX elements you create in React. You likely know that it won't be exactly the same as working with HTML because of the way you apply classes to JSX elements.

// If you import styles from a stylesheet, it isn't much different at all. You apply a class to your JSX element using the className attribute, and apply styles to the class in your stylesheet. Another option is to apply inline styles, which are very common in ReactJS development.

// You apply inline styles to JSX elements similar to how you do it in HTML, but with a few JSX differences. Here's an example of an inline style in HTML:

// <div style="color: yellow; font-size: 16px">Mellow Yellow</div>
// JSX elements use the style attribute, but because of the way JSX is transpiled, you can't set the value to a string. Instead, you set it equal to a JavaScript object. Here's an example:

// <div style={{color: "yellow", fontSize: 16}}>Mellow Yellow</div>
// Notice how we camelCase the fontSize property? This is because React will not accept kebab-case keys in the style object. React will apply the correct property name for us in the HTML.

// Add a style attribute to the div in the code editor to give the text a color of red and font size of 72px.

// Note that you can optionally set the font size to be a number, omitting the units px, or write it as 72px.

class Colorful extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>Big Red</div>
      );
    }
  };

//   37. Add Inline Styles in React
//   You may have noticed in the last challenge that there were several other syntax differences from HTML inline styles in addition to the style attribute set to a JavaScript object. First, the names of certain CSS style properties use camel case. For example, the last challenge set the size of the font with fontSize instead of font-size. Hyphenated words like font-size are invalid syntax for JavaScript object properties, so React uses camel case. As a rule, any hyphenated style properties are written using camel case in JSX.
  
//   All property value length units (like height, width, and fontSize) are assumed to be in px unless otherwise specified. If you want to use em, for example, you wrap the value and the units in quotes, like {fontSize: "4em"}. Other than the length values that default to px, all other property values should be wrapped in quotes.
  
//   If you have a large set of styles, you can assign a style object to a constant to keep your code organized. Declare your styles constant as a global variable at the top of the file. Initialize styles constant and assign an object with three style properties and their values to it. Give the div a color of purple, a font-size of 40, and a border of 2px solid purple. Then set the style attribute equal to the styles constant.

// Change code above this line
class Colorful extends React.Component {
    render() {
      // Change code below this line
      return (
        <div style={{color: "yellow", fontSize: 24}}>Style Me!</div>
      );
      // Change code above this line
    }
  };


//   38. Use Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method
//   In previous challenges, you learned how to inject JavaScript code into JSX code using curly braces, { }, for tasks like accessing props, passing props, accessing state, inserting comments into your code, and most recently, styling your components. These are all common use cases to put JavaScript in JSX, but they aren't the only way that you can utilize JavaScript code in your React components.
  
//   You can also write JavaScript directly in your render methods, before the return statement, without inserting it inside of curly braces. This is because it is not yet within the JSX code. When you want to use a variable later in the JSX code inside the return statement, you place the variable name inside curly braces.
  
//   In the code provided, the render method has an array that contains 20 phrases to represent the answers found in the classic 1980's Magic Eight Ball toy. The button click event is bound to the ask method, so each time the button is clicked a random number will be generated and stored as the randomIndex in state. On line 52, delete the string change me! and reassign the answer const so your code randomly accesses a different index of the possibleAnswers array each time the component updates. Finally, insert the answer const inside the p tags.

const inputStyle = {
    width: 235,
    margin: 5
  };
  
  class MagicEightBall extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        userInput: '',
        randomIndex: ''
      };
      this.ask = this.ask.bind(this);
      this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    }
    ask() {
      if (this.state.userInput) {
        this.setState({
          randomIndex: Math.floor(Math.random() * 20),
          userInput: ''
        });
      }
    }
    handleChange(event) {
      this.setState({
        userInput: event.target.value
      });
    }
    render() {
      const possibleAnswers = [
        'It is certain',
        'It is decidedly so',
        'Without a doubt',
        'Yes, definitely',
        'You may rely on it',
        'As I see it, yes',
        'Outlook good',
        'Yes',
        'Signs point to yes',
        'Reply hazy try again',
        'Ask again later',
        'Better not tell you now',
        'Cannot predict now',
        'Concentrate and ask again',
        "Don't count on it",
        'My reply is no',
        'My sources say no',
        'Most likely',
        'Outlook not so good',
        'Very doubtful'
      ];
      const answer = 'change me!'; // Change this line
      return (
        <div>
          <input
            type='text'
            value={this.state.userInput}
            onChange={this.handleChange}
            style={inputStyle}
          />
          <br />
          <button onClick={this.ask}>Ask the Magic Eight Ball!</button>
          <br />
          <h3>Answer:</h3>
          <p>
            {/* Change code below this line */}
  
            {/* Change code above this line */}
          </p>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }


// 39. Render with an If-Else Condition
// Another application of using JavaScript to control your rendered view is to tie the elements that are rendered to a condition. When the condition is true, one view renders. When it's false, it's a different view. You can do this with a standard if/else statement in the render() method of a React component.

// MyComponent contains a boolean in its state which tracks whether you want to display some element in the UI or not. The button toggles the state of this value. Currently, it renders the same UI every time. Rewrite the render() method with an if/else statement so that if display is true, you return the current markup. Otherwise, return the markup without the h1 element.

// Note: You must write an if/else to pass the tests. Use of the ternary operator will not pass here.

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        display: true
      }
      this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);
    }
    toggleDisplay() {
      this.setState((state) => ({
        display: !state.display
      }));
    }
    render() {
      // Change code below this line
  
      return (
         <div>
           <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
           <h1>Displayed!</h1>
         </div>
      );
    }
  };


// 40. Use && for a More Concise Conditional
// The if/else statements worked in the last challenge, but there's a more concise way to achieve the same result. Imagine that you are tracking several conditions in a component and you want different elements to render depending on each of these conditions. If you write a lot of else if statements to return slightly different UIs, you may repeat code which leaves room for error. Instead, you can use the && logical operator to perform conditional logic in a more concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is true, and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example:

// {condition && <p>markup</p>}
// If the condition is true, the markup will be returned. If the condition is false, the operation will immediately return false after evaluating the condition and return nothing. You can include these statements directly in your JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing && after each one. This allows you to handle more complex conditional logic in your render() method without repeating a lot of code.

// Solve the previous example again, so the h1 only renders if display is true, but use the && logical operator instead of an if/else statement.

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        display: true
      }
      this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);
    }
    toggleDisplay() {
      this.setState(state => ({
        display: !state.display
      }));
    }
    render() {
      // Change code below this line
      return (
         <div>
           <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
           <h1>Displayed!</h1>
         </div>
      );
    }
  };


// 41. Use a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering
// Before moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals to render what you want: the ternary operator. The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for if/else statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional if/else statements, but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, if/else statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago — when an if/else statement was required, it was always outside the return statement. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:

// condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
// The code editor has three constants defined within the CheckUserAge component's render() method. They are called buttonOne, buttonTwo, and buttonThree. Each of these is assigned a simple JSX expression representing a button element. First, initialize the state of CheckUserAge with input and userAge both set to values of an empty string.

// Once the component is rendering information to the page, users should have a way to interact with it. Within the component's return statement, set up a ternary expression that implements the following logic: when the page first loads, render the submit button, buttonOne, to the page. Then, when a user enters their age and clicks the button, render a different button based on the age. If a user enters a number less than 18, render buttonThree. If a user enters a number greater than or equal to 18, render buttonTwo.

const inputStyle = {
    width: 235,
    margin: 5
  };
  
  class CheckUserAge extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      // Change code below this line
  
      // Change code above this line
      this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);
      this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    }
    handleChange(e) {
      this.setState({
        input: e.target.value,
        userAge: ''
      });
    }
    submit() {
      this.setState(state => ({
        userAge: state.input
      }));
    }
    render() {
      const buttonOne = <button onClick={this.submit}>Submit</button>;
      const buttonTwo = <button>You May Enter</button>;
      const buttonThree = <button>You Shall Not Pass</button>;
      return (
        <div>
          <h3>Enter Your Age to Continue</h3>
          <input
            style={inputStyle}
            type='number'
            value={this.state.input}
            onChange={this.handleChange}
          />
          <br />
          {/* Change code below this line */}
  
          {/* Change code above this line */}
        </div>
      );
    }
  }


// 42. Render Conditionally from Props
// So far, you've seen how to use if/else, &&, and the ternary operator (condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse) to make conditional decisions about what to render and when. However, there's one important topic left to discuss that lets you combine any or all of these concepts with another powerful React feature: props. Using props to conditionally render code is very common with React developers — that is, they use the value of a given prop to automatically make decisions about what to render.

// In this challenge, you'll set up a child component to make rendering decisions based on props. You'll also use the ternary operator, but you can see how several of the other concepts that were covered in the last few challenges might be just as useful in this context.

// The code editor has two components that are partially defined for you: a parent called GameOfChance, and a child called Results. They are used to create a simple game where the user presses a button to see if they win or lose.

// First, you'll need a simple expression that randomly returns a different value every time it is run. You can use Math.random(). This method returns a value between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) each time it is called. So for 50/50 odds, use Math.random() >= .5 in your expression. Statistically speaking, this expression will return true 50% of the time, and false the other 50%. In the render method, replace null with the above expression to complete the variable declaration.

// Now you have an expression that you can use to make a randomized decision in the code. Next you need to implement this. Render the Results component as a child of GameOfChance, and pass in expression as a prop called fiftyFifty. In the Results component, write a ternary expression to render the h1 element with the text You Win! or You Lose! based on the fiftyFifty prop that's being passed in from GameOfChance. Finally, make sure the handleClick() method is correctly counting each turn so the user knows how many times they've played. This also serves to let the user know the component has actually updated in case they win or lose twice in a row.

class Results extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
    }
    render() {
      {/* Change code below this line */}
      return <h1></h1>;
      {/* Change code above this line */}
    }
  }
  
  class GameOfChance extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        counter: 1
      };
      this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
    }
    handleClick() {
      this.setState(prevState => {
        // Complete the return statement:
        return {
          counter: prevState
        }
      });
    }
    render() {
      const expression = null; // Change this line
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Play Again</button>
          {/* Change code below this line */}
  
          {/* Change code above this line */}
          <p>{'Turn: ' + this.state.counter}</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }


// 43. Change Inline CSS Conditionally Based on Component State
// At this point, you've seen several applications of conditional rendering and the use of inline styles. Here's one more example that combines both of these topics. You can also render CSS conditionally based on the state of a React component. To do this, you check for a condition, and if that condition is met, you modify the styles object that's assigned to the JSX elements in the render method.

// This paradigm is important to understand because it is a dramatic shift from the more traditional approach of applying styles by modifying DOM elements directly (which is very common with jQuery, for example). In that approach, you must keep track of when elements change and also handle the actual manipulation directly. It can become difficult to keep track of changes, potentially making your UI unpredictable. When you set a style object based on a condition, you describe how the UI should look as a function of the application's state. There is a clear flow of information that only moves in one direction. This is the preferred method when writing applications with React.

// The code editor has a simple controlled input component with a styled border. You want to style this border red if the user types more than 15 characters of text in the input box. Add a condition to check for this and, if the condition is valid, set the input border style to 3px solid red. You can try it out by entering text in the input.

class GateKeeper extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        input: ''
      };
      this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    }
    handleChange(event) {
      this.setState({ input: event.target.value })
    }
    render() {
      let inputStyle = {
        border: '1px solid black'
      };
      // Change code below this line
  
      // Change code above this line
      return (
        <div>
          <h3>Don't Type Too Much:</h3>
          <input
            type="text"
            style={inputStyle}
            value={this.state.input}
            onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </div>
      );
    }
  };


// 44. Use Array.map() to Dynamically Render Elements
// Conditional rendering is useful, but you may need your components to render an unknown number of elements. Often in reactive programming, a programmer has no way to know what the state of an application is until runtime, because so much depends on a user's interaction with that program. Programmers need to write their code to correctly handle that unknown state ahead of time. Using Array.map() in React illustrates this concept.

// For example, you create a simple "To Do List" app. As the programmer, you have no way of knowing how many items a user might have on their list. You need to set up your component to dynamically render the correct number of list elements long before someone using the program decides that today is laundry day.

// The code editor has most of the MyToDoList component set up. Some of this code should look familiar if you completed the controlled form challenge. You'll notice a textarea and a button, along with a couple of methods that track their states, but nothing is rendered to the page yet.

// Inside the constructor, create a this.state object and define two states: userInput should be initialized as an empty string, and toDoList should be initialized as an empty array. Next, delete the null value in the render() method next to the items variable. In its place, map over the toDoList array stored in the component's internal state and dynamically render a li for each item. Try entering the string eat, code, sleep, repeat into the textarea, then click the button and see what happens.

// Note: You may know that all sibling child elements created by a mapping operation like this do need to be supplied with a unique key attribute. Don't worry, this is the topic of the next challenge.

const textAreaStyles = {
    width: 235,
    margin: 5
  };
  
  class MyToDoList extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      // Change code below this line
  
      // Change code above this line
      this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
      this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    }
    handleSubmit() {
      const itemsArray = this.state.userInput.split(',');
      this.setState({
        toDoList: itemsArray
      });
    }
    handleChange(e) {
      this.setState({
        userInput: e.target.value
      });
    }
    render() {
      const items = null; // Change this line
      return (
        <div>
          <textarea
            onChange={this.handleChange}
            value={this.state.userInput}
            style={textAreaStyles}
            placeholder='Separate Items With Commas'
          />
          <br />
          <button onClick={this.handleSubmit}>Create List</button>
          <h1>My "To Do" List:</h1>
          <ul>{items}</ul>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }


// 45. Give Sibling Elements a Unique Key Attribute
// The last challenge showed how the map method is used to dynamically render a number of elements based on user input. However, there was an important piece missing from that example. When you create an array of elements, each one needs a key attribute set to a unique value. React uses these keys to keep track of which items are added, changed, or removed. This helps make the re-rendering process more efficient when the list is modified in any way.

// Note: Keys only need to be unique between sibling elements, they don't need to be globally unique in your application.

// The code editor has an array with some front end frameworks and a stateless functional component named Frameworks(). Frameworks() needs to map the array to an unordered list, much like in the last challenge. Finish writing the map callback to return an li element for each framework in the frontEndFrameworks array. This time, make sure to give each li a key attribute, set to a unique value. The li elements should also contain text from frontEndFrameworks.

// Normally, you want to make the key something that uniquely identifies the element being rendered. As a last resort the array index may be used, but typically you should try to use a unique identification.


const frontEndFrameworks = [
    'React',
    'Angular',
    'Ember',
    'Knockout',
    'Backbone',
    'Vue'
  ];
  
  function Frameworks() {
    const renderFrameworks = null; // Change this line
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Popular Front End JavaScript Frameworks</h1>
        <ul>
          {renderFrameworks}
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  };


// 46. Use Array.filter() to Dynamically Filter an Array
// The map array method is a powerful tool that you will use often when working with React. Another method related to map is filter, which filters the contents of an array based on a condition, then returns a new array. For example, if you have an array of users that all have a property online which can be set to true or false, you can filter only those users that are online by writing:

// let onlineUsers = users.filter(user => user.online);
// In the code editor, MyComponent's state is initialized with an array of users. Some users are online and some aren't. Filter the array so you see only the users who are online. To do this, first use filter to return a new array containing only the users whose online property is true. Then, in the renderOnline variable, map over the filtered array, and return a li element for each user that contains the text of their username. Be sure to include a unique key as well, like in the last challenges.

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        users: [
          {
            username: 'Jeff',
            online: true
          },
          {
            username: 'Alan',
            online: false
          },
          {
            username: 'Mary',
            online: true
          },
          {
            username: 'Jim',
            online: false
          },
          {
            username: 'Sara',
            online: true
          },
          {
            username: 'Laura',
            online: true
          }
        ]
      };
    }
    render() {
      const usersOnline = null; // Change this line
      const renderOnline = null; // Change this line
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Current Online Users:</h1>
          <ul>{renderOnline}</ul>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }


// 47. Render React on the Server with renderToString
// So far, you have been rendering React components on the client. Normally, this is what you will always do. However, there are some use cases where it makes sense to render a React component on the server. Since React is a JavaScript view library and you can run JavaScript on the server with Node, this is possible. In fact, React provides a renderToString() method you can use for this purpose.

// There are two key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app. First, without doing this, your React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file and a large bundle of JavaScript when it's initially loaded to the browser. This may not be ideal for search engines that are trying to index the content of your pages so people can find you. If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send this to the client, the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines. Second, this creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered HTML is smaller than the JavaScript code of the entire app. React will still be able to recognize your app and manage it after the initial load.

// The renderToString() method is provided on ReactDOMServer, which is available here as a global object. The method takes one argument which is a React element. Use this to render App to a string.

class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
    }
    render() {
      return <div/>
    }
  };
